    <h2>The famous Juicy Lucy! Mmmm. So good.</h2>
    <p>A favorite of Minnesotans! The famous Juicy Lucy! Mmmm. So good. You MUST use American cheese on tis to achieve the juiciness in the middle! I like sauteed mushroom and onions on mine!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1½ pounds ground beef </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestersire sauce</li>
        <li>³/⁴ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>4 slices aAmerican cheese (such as Kraft®)</li>
        <li>4 haumburger buns, split</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, garlic salt, and pepper in a large bowl; mix well. Form 8, thin patties from the beef. Each patty should be slightly larger than a slice of cheese.</li>
        <li>Cut each slice of American cheese into 4 equal pieces; stack the pieces. Sandwich one stack of cheese between 2 ground beef patties. Tightly pinch edges together tightly seal the cheese within the meat. Repeat with the remaining cheese and patties.</li>
        <li>Preheat a cast-iron or other heavy bottomed skillet over medium heat. Cook burgers until well browned, about 4 minutes. It is common for burgers to puff up due to steam from the melting cheese. Turn burgers and prick the top of each to allow steam
            to escape; cook until browned on the outside and no longer pink on the inside; about 4 minutes. Serve on hamburger buns.</li>
    </ol>
